**# Sentimental_Analysis**

This project focuses on Sentiment Analysis using Python and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify text as positive, negative, or neutral. Sentiment analysis is widely used in fields such as customer feedback, social media monitoring, and market analysis.


**üìå Overview** 

The goal of this project is to build a sentiment classifier capable of analyzing textual data and predicting the sentiment behind it. The process involves data cleaning, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation. This project leverages machine learning algorithms to classify the sentiment of text data, which can be applied to various datasets, such as customer reviews, social media posts, or movie reviews.


**Key Features**

1.Text Cleaning & Preprocessing: Removing special characters, converting to lowercase, removing stopwords, and tokenization.

2.Feature Extraction: Using TF-IDF vectorization to transform textual data into numerical format.

3.Model Training: Implementing classifiers like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or SVM to predict sentiment.

4.Evaluation: Using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for performance measurement.

5.Visualization: Includes word clouds and sentiment distribution plots for better insights. 

**üìÅ Dataset**
You can use any text-based dataset, such as:

IMDB movie reviews

Twitter sentiment data

Amazon product reviews

Custom CSV/text datasets
